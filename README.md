# OWASP SKF JWT None Algorithm

[OWASP Security Knowledge Framework](https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/) lab [`python/JWT-null`](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/tree/35199b6f49658b75f860530c0f09b91e985198aa/python/JWT-null) from
[SKF labs](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs), by Glenn ten Cate, Riccardo ten Cate and the SKF contributors: a Flask API that accepts JSON Web Tokens whose header says the algorithm is NONE (JWT none algorithm).
This repository runs it with [Isoloom](https://www.isoloom.com): [`isoloom.yml`](isoloom.yml) describes the machine, and
the machine is built from the lab folder vendored unchanged in [`build/web/app/`](build/web/app) by an overlay of its Dockerfile, [`build/web/Dockerfile`](build/web/Dockerfile) (see [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md)).

| Machine | Service |
| --- | --- |
| web | the Python lab on port 5000, published on 5050 |

## Run it

```bash
isoloom generate
isoloom run docker
```

Then open http://localhost:5050/. The same spec runs as Docker on a local VM (`docker-vm`), on a
cloud VM (`cloud-docker`) or on Kubernetes. Lab guide: SKF's write-up [Python - JWT Null](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/blob/35199b6f49658b75f860530c0f09b91e985198aa/md/Python/jwt-null.md) (the source of the SKF write-ups book), with the walkthrough. The write-up uses port 5000; this lab publishes on 5050 because macOS keeps 5000 for AirPlay.
